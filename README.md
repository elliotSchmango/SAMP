# STOMP - Scalable Telemetry & Operations ML Platform
## By Elliot Hong

STOMP simulates a secure, AI-assisted operations monitoring system inspired by real-world needs in utilities, defense, and/or autonomous systems. Its aim is to replicate a modular, scalable platform that handles telemetry data, detects anomalies, and integrates alerting and monitoring â€” mimicking enterprise-level observability and security architectures.
